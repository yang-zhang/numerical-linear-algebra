NMF is a factorization of a non-negative data set $V$: $$ V = W H$$ into non-negative matrices $W,\\; H$. Often positive factors will be **more easily interpretable** (and this is the reason behind NMF's popularity). \n",

In *stochastic* gradient descent, we evaluate our loss function on just a sample of our data (sometimes called a *mini-batch*).  We would get different loss values on different samples of the data, so this is *why it is stochastic*.  It turns out that this is still an effective way to optimize, and it's much more efficient!\n",
